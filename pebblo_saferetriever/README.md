# Overview

`Pebblo SafeRetriever` provides visibility and enforcement for Semantic, Entity, and Identity of context retrieval for RAG applications.

### Identity Enforcement

Identity Enforcement needs two parts:

1. Identity aware data retrieval and vector DB ingestion
2. Identity enforcement on the retrieval chain

#### Identity-aware SafeLoader

Here is the sample code for `GoogleDriveLoader` with `load_auth` parameter set to `True`.

```python
        self.loader = PebbloSafeLoader(
            GoogleDriveLoader(
                folder_id=folder_id,
                token_path="./google_token.json",
                recursive=True,
                file_loader_cls=UnstructuredFileIOLoader,
                file_loader_kwargs={"mode": "elements"},
                load_auth=True,
            ),
            name=self.app_name,  # App name (Mandatory)
            owner="Joe Smith",  # Owner (Optional)
            description="Identity enabled SafeLoader and SafeRetrival app using Pebblo",  # Description (Optional)
        )
```

#### SafeRetrieval

Here is the sample code for `Pebblo SafeRetriever` with `authorized_groups` from the user accessing RAG application passed in `auth_context`

```python
    auth = {
        "authorized_groups": [
            "joe@acme.io",
            "hr-group@acme.io",
            "us-employees-group@acme.io",
    ]}
    retriever = PebbloRetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
        llm=self.llm,
        chain_type="stuff",
        retriever=self.vectordb.as_retriever(),
        verbose=True,
        auth_context=auth,
    )
```

## LangChain

This solution uses the following two private LangChain packages:

* langchain-0.1.12-pebbloretriever
* langchain-community-0.1.12-pebbloretriever

Here are the two corresponding PRs in the LangChain for this feature:

1. community: add authorization identities to GoogleDriveLoader #18813
https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/pull/18813

1. langchain: add PebbloRetrievalQA chain with Identity & Semantic enforcement #18812
https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/pull/18812


### How to run?

#### Pre-requisite:
Download and save credentials.json for your GCP project at `~/.credentials/credentials.json`


#### Steps to run:
1. Setup virtual env and install `langchain/identity-rag/requirements.txt`.
```
pip install -r langchain/identity-rag/requirements.txt
```
2Run the application
```
python3 langchain/identity-rag/pebblo_identity_rag.py
```

3. It will need following inputs:
   1. For the ingestion user:
      1. Admin email address : For listing groups to know the identity.
      2. service-account.json path : Service account credentials file for your google account with enough permissions.
      3. Folder Id : Folder id where the documents to be loaded are stored.
   2. End user email address, against which the identity would be matched.
   3. Prompt by the end user.

Based on all the inputs, it will load the data from given Google Drive folder and
based on the input prompt and it will respond according to
the user level permissions for that user.
