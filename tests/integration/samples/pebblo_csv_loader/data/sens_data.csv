Gradients PDFKit also supports gradient fills. Gradients can be used just like color fills  and are applied with the same methods (e.g. fillColor  or just fill). Before you can apply a gradient with these methods  however  you must create a gradient object. There are two types of gradients: linear and radial. They are created by the linearGradient and radialGradient methods. Their function signatures are listed below: linearGradient.
Limitations It is recommended that you test your PDF form documents across all platforms and viewers that you wish to support. Form Field Appearances Form elements must each have an appearance set using the AP attribute of the annotation. If this attribute is not set  the form element's value may not be visible. Because appearances can be complex to generate  Adobe Acrobat has an option to build these apperances from form values and Form Annotation attributes when a PDF is first opened. To do this PDFKit always sets the Form dictionary's NeedAppearances attribute to true. This could mean that the PDF will be dirty upon open  meaning it will need to be saved. The NeedAppearances flag may not be honored by all PDF viewers. Some form documents may not need to generate appearances. This may be the case for text Form Annotations that initially have no value. This is not true for push button widget annotations. Please test Document JavaScript Many PDF Viewers  aside from Adobe Acrobat Reader  do not implement document JavaScript. Even Adobe Readers may not implement document JavaScript where it is not permitted by a device's app store terms of service (e.g. iOS devices). Radio and Checkboxes Support for radio and checkboxes requires a more advanced attention to their rendered appearances and are not supported in this initial forms release.

A pacemaker is an electrically charged medical device. Your surgeon implants it under your skin to help manage irregular heartbeats called arrhythmias.
Modern pacemakers have two parts. One part  called the pulse generator  contains the battery and the electronics that control your heartbeat. The other part is one or more leads to send electrical signals to your heart. Leads are small wires that run from the pulse generator to your heart.
Some people need a special type of pacemaker called a biventricular pacemaker  or bivent. You may need a bivent if you have severe heart failure. A bivent makes the two sides of the heart beat in sync. This is known as cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT).
