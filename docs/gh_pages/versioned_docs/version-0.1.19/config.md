# Pebblo Configuration File

### Introduction

This configuration file specifies settings for various components of the Pebblo.

### Configuration Details

#### Server

- `port`: Specifies the port number on which the Pebblo server listens for incoming connections.
- `host`: Specifies the host address on which the Pebblo server to run.

Notes:

1. By default `Pebblo Server` runs at `localhost:8000`. When we change values of `port` and/or `host` , the `Pebblo Safe DataLoader` env variable `PEBBLO_CLASSIFIER_URL` needs to set to the correct URL.
2. By default `Pebblo UI` runs at `localhost:8000/pebblo`. When we change values of `port` and/or `host`, the Pebblo UI would be running on the respective `host:port/pebblo`.

### Logging

- `level`: Sets the logging level. Possible values are 'info', 'debug', 'error', 'warning', and 'critical'. Default value is `info`.
- `file`: Sets the log file path. Default value is `/tmp/logs/pebblo.log`.
- `maxFileSize`: Sets the maximum size of the log file. Default value is `8306688` bytes (8 MB).
- `backupCount`: Sets the number of backup files to keep. Default value is `3`.

### Reports

- `format`: Specifies the format of generated reports. Available options include 'pdf'.
- `renderer`: Specifies the rendering engine for generating reports. Options include 'weasyprint', 'xhtml2pdf'.

  > **Note**  
  >  Note: Using xhtml2pdf gives a report with basic UI elements, but WeasyPrint renderer creates a sleeker, better-aligned interface for your PDFs. See image below. If you put renderer as `weasyprint`, then you need to install Pango. Follow [these instructions](./installation.md#install-weasyprint-library) for the same.

- `cacheDir`: Sets the directory where pebblo stores metadata, generated reports, and other temporary files. Default value is `~/.pebblo`.
- `outputDir`: Deprecated. Use `cacheDir` instead.

### Classifier

- `mode`: Specifies mode for classify API. Possible values are `all`, `entity` or `topic`. Default value is `all`. When its value is `all`, both entities and topics will get classified, if value is `entity`, only entities will get classified and vice-versa. It is used for classification in /classify and /loader/doc APIs.
- `anonymizeSnippets`: Flag to anonymize snippets in report. Possible values are 'True' and 'False'. When its value is 'True', snippets in reports will be shown as anonymized and vice versa.

### Storage

This is beta feature introduced in 0.1.18.

- `type`: Specifies storage type to store states of the GenAI applications. Possible values are `file` or `db`. Default value is `file`. By default, SQLite database is used when we set it as `db`.
- `type` as `file` is deprecated, use `type` as `db`. `file` would not be supported from 0.1.19 release.

### Default Configuration

```yaml
daemon:
  port: 8000
  host: localhost
logging:
  level: info
reports:
  format: pdf
  renderer: xhtml2pdf
  outputDir: ~/.pebblo
classifier:
  anonymizeSnippets: False
storage:
  type: file
```

`Note`:
Users have the option to maintain any section or even a single field within a section. For instance, the `config` file might appear as follows:

```yaml
logging:
  level: info
```

This flexibility empowers users to tailor configurations to their specific needs while retaining default values for other sections or fields.
