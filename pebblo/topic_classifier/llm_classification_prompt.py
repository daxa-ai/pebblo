HANDLING SIMILAR DOCUMENTS AND PITFALLS:

1. Document Overlap Scenarios:
   - A contract might appear in LEGAL, SALES, or CUSTOMER categories
   - Financial data might appear in both FINANCE and STRATEGY documents
   - Employee information might span both HR and HEALTH categories

2. How to Handle Overlaps:
   - Primary Purpose: Identify the document's main purpose
   - Context Matters: Consider who created it and its intended audience
   - Multiple Classifications: When truly appropriate, assign multiple classes
   - Hierarchical Thinking: Consider if one classification naturally contains another

3. Common Pitfalls to Avoid:
   - Don't classify based on single keywords without context
   - Don't ignore document metadata or formatting
   - Don't force-fit into a single category if multiple apply
   - Don't overlook the document's intended use case
   - Don't classify based on superficial similarities

4. Resolution Guidelines:
   - For contracts: Check if it's primarily about sales (SALES), customer relationship (CUSTOMER), or legal compliance (LEGAL)
   - For policies: Determine if it's governance-wide (GOVERNANCE) or department-specific (HR, SECURITY, etc.)
   - For financial data: Distinguish between pure financial reporting (FINANCE) and strategic planning (STRATEGY)
   - For technical documents: Separate product specifications (PRODUCT) from intellectual property documentation (IP)

You have to analyze and think deeply about the given text and classify it into one or more of the above classes.
See, you have to ruminate on the text, break it down, think from different perspectives, analyze different aspects of the text and classify it.

Think step by step:
1. Document Structure Analysis
2. Content Theme Identification
3. Purpose Assessment
4. Stakeholder Analysis
5. Cross-category Evaluation
6. Final Classification Decision

Pay attention to the details:
- Look for specific terminology or jargon associated with each category
- Consider document structure and formatting
- Identify key stakeholders mentioned
- Evaluate the document's intended purpose
- Assess the level of technical detail
- Consider the document's lifecycle and workflow implications

Try to understand:
- Author's intent and authority level
- Target audience and their roles
- Document's place in organizational workflow
- Immediate and long-term purpose of the document
- Security and privacy implications
- Cross-departmental implications

You must output in the following XML format:

<ANALYSIS>
{analysis} - COMPLETELY DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THE TEXT.
Think using at least 100 words but no more than 300 words. Think and analyze deeply.
Your goal is to classify the text into one or more of the given classes.

Here's how you should analyze:
- First, understand the document's context and structure
- Identify primary and secondary purposes
- Consider all stakeholders involved
- Evaluate technical content and jargon
- Assess security and privacy implications
- Consider cross-departmental relevance
- Look for category overlap indicators
- Consider who this document is for and who might be the sender
- Use expert level analysis and reasoning

The classification decision must come after this analysis.
</ANALYSIS>

<CLASSIFICATION>
[{classification}] - AN ARRAY OF WORDS FROM THE 12 CLASSES LISTED ABOVE
- Multiple classes are allowed if appropriate
- Must be based on thorough analysis
- Should reflect both primary and secondary purposes if applicable
</CLASSIFICATION>

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. Never make assumptions before complete analysis
2. Don't let document format alone determine classification
3. Consider both explicit and implicit content
4. Watch for category overlap indicators
5. Don't force-fit into a single category
6. Consider document lifecycle and workflow
7. Pay attention to security and privacy implications
